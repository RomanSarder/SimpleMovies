To fire up project you need to run npm install / yarn, then npm start / yarn start

Project contains 2 sections:
  - Popular movies
  - Now playing TV series

Attention: API tends to lag sometimes. You can find it lagging most often in now_playing section, especially when you click on pagination item. It can be that for 1-3 seconds nothing happens - it's because of pending request.
